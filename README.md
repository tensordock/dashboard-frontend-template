# TensorDock Storefront Template

## Updating content

Make sure to `npm install` in this folder. To update your whitelabel site, `npm run export`. This will create `site.zip`, which you can upload to [dashboard.tensordock.com/organization/storefront/panel](https://dashboard.tensordock.com/organization/storefront/panel).

## React SPA Template

The `web` folder is a single-page React application. See the inner [README](./web/README.md) for more details.

## Email templates

Since emails can't fetch data dynamically, we instead use templating. All emails have the following base template variables, which you probably won't need but are here just in case:

- `app_base_url`: Base URL for whitelabel site, i.e. `https://gpufleet.com`
- `org_title`: Organization name

Templating uses `{{ variablename }}` format.

### `account_confirmation.html`

This email is sent when a user signs up for a new account.

- `"{{ app_base_url }}/confirm/{{ token }}"` will be the account creation confirmation link.

### `deposit_confirmation.html`

This email is sent to confirm a deposit into an organization's balance.

- `${{ amount }}` is the deposit amount, i.e. `$20.24`

### `account_low_balance_3.html`

Sent to notify a user that their balance is below $3.

### `account_low_balance_5.html`

Sent to notify a user that their balance is below $10.

### `account_low_balance_custom.html`

Sent when a user has set up a custom action to notify them of their balance being below a custom threshold.

- `${{ threshold }}` is the threshold they've set.

### `auto_charge`

- `{{ card_last4 }}`: Last 4 digits of card used for auto payment.

### `auto_charge_failed`

Sent when an automated charge based on low threshold fails (user-configured).

- `${{ charge }}`: Amount that would have been charged.
- `${{ threshold }}`: Threshold for auto charge set by user.

### `alert_servers_stopped`

Sent when an org's balance hits $1, and their servers are stopped.
